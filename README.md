# Project Zohar

This project is for all Xenoblade Chronicles fans alike that will help them track their progress and provide help across all three mainline games. This project is named "Project Zohar" after the Zohar which is featured in the Xenosaga series and had several appearances across the Xenoblade Chonicles games. This is an easy to use webapp I have also put instructions on how to use it below.

## How to Access

By simply going to www.project-zohar.com on any device you should be able to access the most up to date version of the webapp with ease.

## How to Use

You start on the home page and from there you can choose the game that you would like to start tracking.

For the sake of this tutorial I will be using Xenoblade Chronicles 1. After selecting your game you will be taken to the Introduction page for your game.

From here, select your category and start checking off everything that you have done by clicking on the associated row. Everything is saved locally to your browser so don't be afraid to close the tab and continue later.

## Tech Stack

This app is developed using React and Javascipt to help distinguish from the different components. I also used the Node Package Manager to help with the frontend of the website. Finally, localstorage is used to store everything that the user has clicked on. It is a very simple app with very simple code.

# Conclusion

I hope that you enjoy using this I have some plans for updates in the future and I hope I can release them soon! :)
